        <h5>Traditional education is defined as teacher-centered delivery of instruction to classes of students who are the receivers of information. Traditional schools generally stress basic educational practices and expect mastery of academic learning in the core subjects of math, reading, writing, science and social studies. Public schools generally follow this educational model, although charter schools can offer a more flexible educational approach. </h5>
        <h5>In its current framework, the system rewards participants for playing it safe and maintaining the status quo. Those who support the need for education, such as employers, have continued to accept that students need to “check the boxes.” The overhead generated by these old systems have led to massive overpayments by the students, underpayments to the educators, and massive debt burdens held by society.</h5>
        <h5>CoeusDAO seeks to improve all that including better access to educational opportunities, facilitate resource coordination, and provide practical knowledge and experience verification mechanisms using ETHEREUM</h5>
